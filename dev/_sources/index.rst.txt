Siphon
======

Siphon is a collection of Python utilities for downloading data from remote
data services. Much of Siphon's current functionality focuses on access to
data hosted on a `THREDDS Data Server`__. It also provides clients to a variety
of simple web services.

Siphon follows `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_ in its version number. With our
current 0.x version, that implies that Siphon's APIs (application programming interfaces) are
still evolving (we won't break things just for fun, but many things are still changing as we
work through design issues). Also, for a version `0.x.y`, we change `x` when we
release new features, and `y` when we make a release with only bug fixes.

We support Python >= 3.7.
